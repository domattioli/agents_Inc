## 1. Status & Roadmap

Version 0.4.1. The project is experimental and pre-MVP. The governed path (`WORKERBEES_GOVERNANCE`) is off by default. Changes per release are in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). The build plan and cut line are in [docs/PLAN-MVP.md](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/docs/PLAN-MVP.md). Open work is tracked in [the issues](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/issues).

- **Now:** measure the token cost of delegation against doing the work in one session.
- **Next:** let a Worker launched by a broker lead its own Workers ([#73](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/issues/73)).
- **Later:** route work by data classification, so unpublished work reaches only approved providers ([#19](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/issues/19)).

## 2. Why it exists

Delegated model work can look done while it is wrong. A flat pool of agents has no way to catch that. `agents_Inc` borrows a [corporate org chart](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/docs/governance/DELEGATION-MODEL.md). The CEO is you. The CoS (chief of staff) is the session you talk to. A Lead manages one run, and a Worker reports to a Lead.

Cheap models take routine work, and costlier models manage. An author never grades its own work: the Lead checks what its Workers report before anything moves up. Savings are not yet measured, so none are claimed ([docs/PLAN-MVP.md](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/docs/PLAN-MVP.md)).

<div align="right"><a href="#agents_inc"><sub>^ Back to top</sub></a></div>

## 3. Installation

Requirements: Python 3.10 or later, Bash 3.2 or later, `jq`, `curl`, and the Claude Code CLI signed in to an Anthropic subscription. The Codex CLI is optional; when present, it serves the Codex rungs and cross-vendor review.

```bash
pip install agents-inc
agents-inc install     # skills ship in the package; no checkout needed
agents-inc doctor      # first line prints READY when the install works
```

Restart Claude Code (and Codex, if used) after the install. `agents-inc install --without-codex` skips Codex on purpose. To install from a git checkout instead, pass `--source <checkout>`. Optional Gemini, Mistral and OpenRouter keys, the setup decision tree and key storage rules are in [docs/START-HERE.md](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/docs/START-HERE.md).

### Hooks this installs

`agents-inc install` adds these hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`. It prints the list when it runs.

- `SessionStart`: loads the delegation mandate into each session.
- `PreToolUse` on `Agent`/`Task`, dispatch-shaped `Bash` and `DelegateAgent`: adds a routing nudge, warns on duplicate dispatches, blocks persona impersonation, and runs the agent gate.
- `PostToolUse` on `Agent`/`Task`: marks the dispatch done.
- `UserPromptSubmit`: routes `@alias` side questions.

**Agent gate.** Claude's `Agent` tool skips agents-inc routing, prompt lint, the ledger and verification. The gate decides what happens to those calls.

| Mode | Effect |
|---|---|
| `advisory` (default) | Nothing is blocked. The session sees a nudge toward `agents-inc dispatch`. |
| `enforce` | Blocks every `Agent`/`Task` call except foreground `Explore`, `Plan`, `claude-code-guide` and `statusline-setup`. Background runs are always blocked. |
| `off` | Same as advisory. Doctor reports it as off. |

- Switch mode: `agents-inc repair --agent-gate enforce|advisory|off`. The choice lives in `~/.config/agents-inc/settings.json`.
- One session only: launch with `AGENTS_INC_AGENT_GATE=off claude` (or `enforce`).
- Check: `agents-inc doctor` prints `agent gate: <mode> (<source>)`.
- Remove every agents-inc hook: `agents-inc unwire`. Other hooks stay. `agents-inc repair` adds them back.

**Using agents-inc without the gate.**

- Use `Agent` only for read-only, foreground scouts.
- Send anything that writes files, runs long, nests or belongs in the ledger through `agents-inc dispatch`.
- Naming a model chooses the rung, not the route. "Use sonnet" still means `agents-inc dispatch --model sonnet`.
- Subagents get no SessionStart mandate. If an `Agent` prompt may delegate, say in it: sub-delegate only via `agents-inc dispatch`.
- Verify what an `Agent` call returns yourself, as for any delegate.

## 4. Quick start

Name your models in plain English. The ladder decides who manages whom, and the rest fills in. You do not hand-pick every model or write JSON.

Write the request to the CoS as `<task>. <models>.`, for example:

> "Fix the parser. opus, haiku."

The higher rung manages and the lower rung reports to it, so opus is the Lead and haiku is its Worker. Defaults fill the rest: effort medium, gates derived from the task, and the home repo from the consumer's `AGENTS.md`. Each extra word, such as an effort level, overrides one default.

| Rung | Claude | Codex | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Executive | fable | astra | Final say, irreversible acts, conflicting results |
| Orchestrator | opus | sol | Decompose, dispatch, plan |
| Workhorse | sonnet | terra | Normal coding, research, synthesis |
| Grunt | haiku | luna | Classify, extract, summarize; free Gemini, Mistral and OpenRouter models enter only here |

The CoS then runs one command. It renders the prompt, lints it, snapshots the tree, launches the delegate and checks the report:

```bash
agents-inc dispatch --slots slots.json --model sonnet --dry-run   # drop --dry-run to launch
agents-inc models chain supervisor=opus                            # change the default REPORTING CHAIN
```

Every dispatch prompt carries a `REPORTING CHAIN` line derived from the ladder, and every launched dispatch writes one `dispatched` row to the ledger. Codex delegates can write to `--cwd` by default, the same as a Claude subagent; the slot `CODEX_WRITE: no` makes one read-only. A worked slots file is in [skills/workerbee/slots.md](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/skills/workerbee/slots.md).

Two more entry points need no dispatch. `PYTHONPATH=. python3 tools/governance_demo.py --fake`, run from a checkout, shows routing, policy checks and ledger records with no provider keys. `@haiku <question>` inside any Claude Code session sends one side question to a cheaper model before the session model runs ([docs/at-route/AT-ROUTE.md](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/docs/at-route/AT-ROUTE.md)).

## 5. How it works

![Delegation and support flow: CEO, CoS, Lead, and Worker roles across the nine speckit phases, with model rungs shown as cost classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/main/docs/assets/delegation-model.svg)

- **Routing.** A router picks the vendor and rung for each task from a written policy ([agents_inc/routing.json](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/agents_inc/routing.json)). Rung names are cost classes, not job titles; the reporting chain sets the role.
- **Grilling and speckit.** The CoS grills you one question at a time until the request is sharp, then a speckit pipeline gates it through spec, plan, tasks and review.
- **Verification.** A deterministic verifier checks cited claims with no model call. A reviewer from a different vendor then checks the meaning. A Worker's own PASS never decides acceptance.
- **Ledger.** An append-only JSONL and SQLite ledger records every dispatch, return, review and acceptance decision.
- **Models.** Each Codex alias is pinned to one slug. `agents-inc models` reports drift. Model sync promotes new Codex slugs in `approve` or `auto` mode and skips pinned aliases.

The full description, including the delegation limits, the 14-element prompt contract, the verification flow and the comparison with other tools, is in [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md).

## 6. Limitations

- Cost savings and accuracy against a baseline are not measured. Passing local tests show that the code behaves as written, not that it is reliable in production.
- The governed path is off by default, so a fresh install does not run the enforced cross-vendor review.
- Cross-vendor review catches disagreement between models. It does not catch a blind spot that both vendors share.
- Deterministic checks cover what a script can express, such as a file, a quote or an exit code. They do not replace human judgment on scope or design.
- Free-model capacity varies: a probe on 2026-09-29 found 429 or capacity errors on several free models ([docs/BENCH.md](https://github.com/domattioli/agents_Inc/blob/main/docs/BENCH.md)). Artifacts stay local; remote publication (Bindle Backend B) is not built.

Updates: new sessions and `agents-inc doctor` tell you when a newer release is on PyPI (one check a day; `AGENTS_INC_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` turns it off).

Found a bug or want a feature? `agents-inc report bug --title "..." --body "..."` (or `report feature`) prints a draft issue with your version, doctor result and OS; home paths become `~`. Add `--submit` to file it on GitHub with your own `gh` login.
