description: Chain the spec-driven-development phases (specify → clarify → plan → tasks → checklist → analyze → implement) into one guided pipeline. Runs specify, pauses at an interactive clarify gate, then advances unattended (under act-autonomously discipline) through plan, tasks, checklist, and analyze, auto-resolving analyze findings (≤3 cycles), and finishes with implement. Deterministic skip/add phase selection, per-phase agent/model/effort dispatch, optional nested-notes summary and accelerate illustration. Use when you want a whole feature taken from a plain-language description to an implemented change with a single invocation instead of hand-running seven commands. Pairs speckit-* (the phases it orchestrates), act-autonomously (unattended discipline), nested-notes + accelerate (optional outputs).

# speckit-pipeline

One orchestration skill that carries a feature from a plain-language description to an implemented change by chaining the existing `speckit-*` phase skills into a single guided run. The main session **is** the orchestrator: it follows this procedure turn by turn, running main-session-tier phases inline via the `Skill` tool and dispatching subagent-tier phases via the `Agent` tool. It replaces the manual chore of invoking `/speckit-specify`, `/speckit-clarify`, `/speckit-plan`, `/speckit-tasks`, `/speckit-checklist`, `/speckit-analyze`, and `/speckit-implement` in sequence and hand-resolving analyze findings.

## Metadata

- **Category**: Spec-Driven Development / Orchestration
- **Use Case**: Take one feature from description to implementation in a single guided invocation
- **Dependencies**: the `speckit-*` phase skills, `act-autonomously`, `nested-notes`, `accelerate`, the `cavecrew-builder` preset, `python3` (stdlib), `bash`
- **Scope**: One feature per invocation; orchestrates 7 default phases + 4 insertable + 2 optional outputs

## When to Use

- You have a feature idea and want the full spec → implement pipeline run for you, with one human checkpoint.
- You want a tailored pipeline (skip phases you don't need, add optional ones) but keep a deterministic order.
- You want a routine/cron session to run the whole pipeline unattended (`--yes`).

## When NOT to Use

- You only need one phase — invoke that phase skill directly.
- The feature is already specified and you only want to implement — run `/speckit-implement`.
- You are outside a spec-kit-initialized project (no `.specify/`) — initialize first.

## The pipeline

Canonical default order (FR-002):

```
specify → clarify → plan → tasks → checklist → analyze → implement
```

Insertable phases (FR-022), each at a fixed canonical position: `constitution` (before specify), `tasks-to-issues` + `split` (after tasks), `commit` (after implement). `clarify` is the single interactive human gate; everything after it runs unattended.

### Analyze vs. converge — two different checks, two different positions

`analyze` and the (upstream) `converge` command look similar but check different things at different points in the pipeline, and conflating them is a real design trap:

- **`analyze` is a pre-implement, cross-artifact consistency check.** It reads `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` and reports where those three artifacts disagree with each other. It inspects no code (there is none yet — it runs before `implement`), so its findings are resolved by editing the *artifacts*, never by writing code. This is why the pipeline runs `analyze` at position 6 and its resolve loop (Step 6) makes artifact edits, not implementation edits. Pairing `analyze` findings with an `implement` "fix" is the wrong tool for the wrong layer.
- **`converge` is a post-implement, code-vs-spec check.** It assesses the *code* against `spec.md`/`plan.md`/`tasks.md` and appends any remaining unbuilt work as new tasks, so a follow-up `implement` closes the gap. It must run *after* `implement` by contract.

**Future work — `speckit-converge` phase (not yet available in DomI).** Upstream `github/spec-kit` ships a `converge` command (PR #3001); DomI has not yet ported it as a `speckit-converge` phase skill. When it lands, the intended shape is a bounded post-implement convergence loop — `implement → converge → (tasks appended?) → implement → converge …`, capped at ~3 cycles — added as a default phase after `implement` (order between `implement` and `commit`). The loop is bounded rather than exit-code-driven because a `converged` pass leaves `tasks.md` byte-for-byte unchanged, making extra iterations safe no-ops. This is deliberately **not** wired into the registry today: with no `speckit-converge` skill on disk, `preflight.sh` would fail any run that included the phase. Port the skill first, then add the phase.

## Modes

Two modes select the Execution Policy table below. **New mode is DEFAULT** — no flag needed. `--legacy` opts into the old hardcoded-model table (retained for callers not ready to move). See `specs/008-pipeline-model-classes/spec.md` (consumer-side spec) for the rationale and the class→collision resolutions this table reflects.

- **New mode (default)**: phases bind to a provider-agnostic CLASS (`Executive`/`Orchestrator` (aka `Supervisor`)/`Workhorse`/`Grunt`/`free`) instead of a hardcoded model name. **agents_for_dummies-native addition (D35, 2026-09-07):** CLASS → concrete model resolution is a real script, not eyeballed prose — run `python3 skills/speckit-pipeline/scripts/resolve_rung.py <CLASS>` (parses `docs/governance/ROUTING-RANKING.md` live, so it can never drift from canon; fails closed — non-zero exit, no guess — on an unrecognized rung or a missing/reshaped table). If `docs/governance/ROUTING-RANKING.md` is absent entirely (a repo without this repo's rung ladder), fall back to the legacy table's model column for that phase and emit one warning line. Default effort is `medium` everywhere (was `high` on constitution/specify/plan/analyze). `clarify-surrogate` is **disabled**: see Step 5. The analyze retry cap is **2** cycles, not 3: see Step 6. Preflight tolerates a missing `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh`: see Step 3. **Every phase dispatch is also recorded into this repo's real dispatch ledger** — see Step 4's ledger sub-step — giving pipeline runs the same lineage/cost-rollup/lint visibility as any other governed dispatch in this repo, and threading a sha256 of each phase's deliverable through the same (imperfect, already-existing) artifact-hash path spec 006 documents, so Bindle can pick it up later with zero pipeline-side change once it's built (it is not built yet — this only readies the seam).
- **Legacy mode (`--legacy`)**: unchanged dispatch targets (Plan/general-purpose/adversarial-reviewer/cavecrew-builder, same models), but default effort also drops `high` → `medium` on every row that previously said `high` (operator ruling, aligns with the same medium-by-default direction as new mode). Everything else in legacy mode (clarify-surrogate enabled, 3-cycle analyze retry cap, hard-required `check-prerequisites.sh`) is unchanged from v1.4.

## Execution Policy (dispatch map)

Canonical copy lives in `specs/017-speckit-workflow/spec.md` (`## Execution Policy`) and `data-model.md`. Mirrored here as the forcing function the orchestrator consults per phase — if this diverges from the spec on a future edit, the spec wins.

**New mode (default):**

| Phase | Agent | Class | Effort | Caveman |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| constitution | main session | session | medium | none (artifact) |
| specify | main session | session | medium | none (artifact) |
| clarify | main session | session | session | light (human gate) |
| plan | `Plan` | Orchestrator | medium | dispatch max · `plan.md` none |
| tasks | `general-purpose` | Workhorse | medium | dispatch max · `tasks.md` none |
| tasks-to-issues | `general-purpose` | Grunt | low | dispatch max · issue light |
| split | `general-purpose` | Grunt | low | dispatch max · issue light |
| checklist | `general-purpose` | Grunt | low | dispatch max · none |
| analyze | `adversarial-reviewer` | Workhorse (escalate Orchestrator if findings conflict) | medium | dispatch max · report max |
| implement | `cavecrew-builder` preset (`general-purpose`/Grunt) | Grunt | medium (escalate Workhorse if broad, per D27 promotion) | dispatch max · **code normal** |
| commit | main session | session | low | `caveman-commit` |

Class → concrete model is resolved from `docs/governance/ROUTING-RANKING.md` at dispatch time, not hardcoded here (avoids the drift 007 removes). `implement` still lands on a Grunt-tier builder by default per the coding-dispatch binding; escalation to Workhorse follows the same promotion triggers as any other rung (two failed checks, quota pause, or a Lead-assigned gate reason) — never on confidence alone.

**Legacy mode (`--legacy`):**

| Phase | Agent | Model | Effort | Caveman |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| constitution | main session | session | medium | none (artifact) |
| specify | main session | session | medium | none (artifact) |
| clarify | main session | session | session | light (human gate) |
| plan | `Plan` | opus/sonnet | medium | dispatch max · `plan.md` none |
| tasks | `general-purpose` | sonnet | medium | dispatch max · `tasks.md` none |
| tasks-to-issues | `general-purpose` | haiku | low | dispatch max · issue light |
| split | `general-purpose` | haiku | low | dispatch max · issue light |
| checklist | `general-purpose` | haiku | low | dispatch max · none |
| analyze | `adversarial-reviewer` | sonnet/opus | medium | dispatch max · report max |
| implement | `cavecrew-builder` preset (`general-purpose`/haiku) | haiku | medium (escalate high if broad) | dispatch max · **code normal** |
| commit | main session | session | low | `caveman-commit` |

Not pipeline phases (excluded from skip/add): `resolve-issues` (internal analyze sub-loop, ≤3 cycles legacy / ≤2 cycles new mode), `summary` (`--summary` → `nested-notes`), `illustrate` (`--illustrate` → `accelerate`). Caveman is audience-scoped (#387): maximum intensity on machine-facing subagent dispatch prompts, light on human-facing recaps/clarify, never on generated artifacts or code.

## Protocol

### Step 1: Parse arguments

Read `$ARGUMENTS`: the feature description (required, FR-001; error out if empty). Flags: `--legacy` (opt into the legacy Execution Policy table + legacy clarify/analyze/preflight behavior — see Modes; default is new mode without this flag), `--skip <csv>`, `--add <csv>`, `--plan-only` (planning-only run — skips `implement`, implies `--allow-required-skip`; for checkpoint/diagnosis runs that stop before code, #405), `--allow-required-skip` (permit `--skip` to target a required phase `specify`/`implement`; the dependency check still guards), `--yes` (autonomous — in legacy mode delegates the clarify phase to a `clarify-surrogate` subagent instead of a human; in new mode `clarify-surrogate` is disabled and `--yes` still halts at the clarify gate for the operator, see Step 5; does NOT skip clarification either way, FR-020), `--summary[=granularity,mode]` (FR-007/008), `--illustrate` (FR-009), `--parallel` (opt-in fan-out, FR-024).

### Step 2: Resolve the phase set (deterministic)

Shell out once to the resolver, capture the ordered plan, branch on exit code:

```
python3 skills/speckit-pipeline/scripts/resolve_phases.py --skip "$SKIP" --add "$ADD" --json
```

Exit codes: `0` OK · `10` unknown phase name (stderr lists valid names) · `11` skip/add name conflict · `12` add name not insertable · `13` skip targets a required phase (`specify`/`implement`) **without** `--allow-required-skip`/`--plan-only` (the required guard is opt-out, not absolute — a forced skip that breaks a dependency still fails with `14`) · `14` dependency break (all violations listed). On any non-zero code, report the resolver's message to the operator and stop — do not run a partial or incoherent pipeline (FR-012/FR-013). Ordering is deterministic by construction (SC-002/SC-003): the resolver consumes skip/add only as sets and derives order from a single fixed key.

### Step 3: Preflight (before the first dispatch)

```
bash skills/speckit-pipeline/scripts/preflight.sh <resolved phase ids...>
```

Verifies every resolved phase's skill is present (via the id→skill-dir map — `tasks-to-issues→speckit-taskstoissues`, `commit→speckit-git-commit`, `constitution→speckit-constitution`, `split→speckit-split`, else `speckit-<id>`) and that `.specify/` exists (FR-015). Missing pieces are reported now, never mid-pipeline. Also preflight the optional-output skills if their flags are set; a missing one is a warning, not a blocker (FR-016).

Several phase skills (`checklist`, `tasks`, `tasks-to-issues`, `clarify`, `analyze`, `implement`) call `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh` themselves at their own Setup step. **New mode** tolerates that script being absent: preflight checks for it and, if missing, emits one warning (`WARN: .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh not found — phases that depend on it may fail at their own Setup step`) instead of failing the whole preflight, since a consumer repo not scaffolded by upstream `spec-kit` may not carry it. **Legacy mode** keeps the old behavior: the script's absence is not itself preflighted (unchanged from v1.4 — the affected phase simply fails at its own Setup step when it hits the missing script).

### Step 4: Execute each resolved phase in order

For each phase, consult the Execution Policy table:

- **Main-session-tier** (`constitution`, `specify`, `commit`, and `clarify` when `--yes` is NOT set): run inline via `Skill(skill="speckit-<id>")`.
- **`clarify` under `--yes`**: dispatched to the `clarify-surrogate` persona via `Agent(agentType="clarify-surrogate")` — see Step 5.
- **Subagent-tier** (`plan`, `tasks`, `checklist`, `analyze`, `implement`, `tasks-to-issues`, `split`): dispatch via `Agent` with the phase's own canonical Outline **transcluded fresh from disk** (`skills/<skill-dir>/SKILL.md`) into the prompt — never a baked-in copy, so the pipeline never drifts from the standalone phase skills (FR-025). `cavecrew-builder` is a preset (`general-purpose`/haiku), not a raw subagent type — resolve it. Code-writing (`implement`) MUST go to a Haiku builder subagent per the repo's coding-dispatch binding; the main session integrates and verifies.
- **After every dispatch**: verify the expected on-disk artifact was produced (`git status`/diff on the expected path) before proceeding. A subagent's self-reported success is not trusted until the artifact is on disk (guards the Haiku false-completion mode).
- Record each phase's outcome (ran/skipped/succeeded/failed) to `.specify/workflow-state.json` (FR-017/FR-026) so the ledger survives context compaction or resume.
- **New mode only — record into this repo's real dispatch ledger (D35), record-only, never blocking:**
  1. Before the phase's `Agent`/`Skill` call: `python3 skills/speckit-pipeline/scripts/resolve_rung.py <CLASS>` to get the concrete model(s) for the phase's table row (escalate to `escalate_to` per the same D27 promotion trigger everything else in this repo uses — two failed checks on this phase, provider quota pause, or an explicit gate reason; never on confidence).
  2. Still before the call: `python3 skills/speckit-pipeline/scripts/ledger_bridge.py dispatch --run-id <pipeline run's uuid, one per pipeline invocation> --node-id <fresh uuid> --model <resolved slug> --rung <CLASS> --task speckit-<phase> --provider claude|codex [--parent-id <this run's root node>] [--gate-reason "<reason, required when the rung mapped to frontier>"]` — capture the printed node id.
  3. Run the phase exactly as already specified (Agent tool / Skill tool, unchanged).
  4. After the phase's artifact is verified on disk: `python3 skills/speckit-pipeline/scripts/ledger_bridge.py return --node-id <from step 2> --status verified|needs-review|red --seconds <elapsed> --artifact-file <the phase's produced file, e.g. plan.md>`.
  5. A ledger write failure here is never a pipeline failure (`ledger.py`'s own FR-008 posture — `record_dispatch`/`record_return` never raise) — this bridge fails open by design; a run that can't reach `.workerbees/` still completes.

### Step 5: The clarify gate

**Default (`--yes` not set)** — run `clarify` inline. Present the clarification questions and **end the turn to wait** for operator answers (FR-003) — an ordinary conversational boundary, which is how the interactive gate is realized.

**`--yes` set, legacy mode** — `--yes` does **not** mean skip clarification; it means no human is present to answer it, so a surrogate answers instead (FR-020):

1. Run `/speckit-clarify`'s own question-generation logic (its ambiguity scan + prioritized queue) as normal, but do not present the questions to a human.
2. Dispatch `Agent(agentType="clarify-surrogate")` — **do not pass an explicit `model` override on this call.** The persona's own frontmatter (`.claude/agents/clarify-surrogate.md`) has no `model:` field for exactly this reason: it must inherit the orchestrating session's current model, so an unattended run's clarification quality tracks the tier the rest of the run is using, not a hardcoded one. Pass it the drafted spec and the generated questions (with their suggested-options tables); its own SKILL.md-equivalent persona instructions govern how it grounds and answers.
3. Integrate each returned answer into the spec exactly as `/speckit-clarify` integrates a human's answer (its own Step 5 integration rules — `## Clarifications` section, per-section updates, save after each).
4. Emit one warning line: `WARN: clarify answered by clarify-surrogate (model inherited from this session), not the operator — see spec Clarifications section for grounding.` This is what the FR-017 audit ledger uses to record that a human never actually weighed in on this run's clarification.
5. **If the surrogate flags any question unresolved** (its own escalation rules: insufficient grounding, security/scope/privacy stakes, or a materially shape-changing decision the spec leaves open), treat this exactly like any other unsafe-to-continue condition (FR-020a/FR-006): halt **before** `plan`, name the unresolved question and why, and do not guess. This is a correct, intended outcome — it means the run correctly recognized it should not proceed unattended past this point.

**`--yes` set, new mode (default)** — `clarify-surrogate` is **disabled**, unconditionally. A surrogate answering the operator's own clarify questions and then feeding that into `plan` is a self-graded input (constitution P3) — new mode does not run this pattern at all, not even opt-in. Instead: run `/speckit-clarify`'s question-generation logic as normal, then **halt and end the turn**, presenting the generated questions to the operator exactly as the non-`--yes` path does. `--yes` in new mode therefore affects only the phases *after* clarify (no acknowledgment theater between them, per `act-autonomously`) — it does not remove the human clarify checkpoint. Emit one line: `NOTE: --yes does not bypass clarify in new mode (clarify-surrogate disabled, P3) — halting for operator answers.` An operator who explicitly wants the old surrogate behavior must pass `--legacy` as well.

**`--skip clarify`** (structurally separate from `--yes`) removes the phase from the effective set entirely — a true no-answers skip, with none of the surrogate's grounding or halting behavior. An operator who explicitly wants the old bare-skip behavior uses `--skip clarify`, not `--yes`. The two controls are independent: `--yes` alone never results in zero answers (it either gets surrogate answers or halts); `--skip clarify` alone never invokes the surrogate (the phase doesn't run at all).

### Step 6: The analyze → resolve-issues loop

Dispatch `analyze` (`adversarial-reviewer`, read-only — it reports, never edits). Because `analyze` is a cross-artifact consistency check (see "Analyze vs. converge" above), every fix in this loop is an **artifact** edit to `spec.md`/`plan.md`/`tasks.md`, never an implementation edit — the code doesn't exist yet at this point. For each surfaced finding, apply the fix (main session, or a `cavecrew-builder` subagent for larger edits), then re-run `analyze`. Repeat **up to 2 cycles in new mode, 3 cycles in legacy mode**; on the final still-unresolved cycle, halt and report the unresolved findings to the operator (FR-005/FR-021). New mode's lower cap matches this repo's own retired 3-count convention. The cycle counter is persisted to `.specify/workflow-state.json` (FR-026). The post-implement code-vs-spec gap is a separate concern handled by the future `converge` phase, not by this loop.

### Step 7: Unattended discipline & halting

From clarify-satisfied through implement, follow `act-autonomously` verbatim: no acknowledgment theater between phases, log every skip/fallback (silent-deviation ban), and apply its Hard-Stop-vs-Handle-and-Continue table — halt on destructive or irreversible actions during `implement` rather than proceeding blindly (FR-018). Any phase failure that is not auto-resolvable or is unsafe to continue past halts **before** implement, naming the phase and reason (FR-006).

### Step 8: Optional outputs (post-pipeline)

- `--summary` → `Skill(skill="nested-notes", ...)` at light caveman, passing granularity/render-mode through (FR-007/008).
- `--illustrate` → `Skill(skill="accelerate")` to present an image of the result (FR-009).

Both are independent of each other and of the pipeline (FR-014); a missing capability yields one warning and the core result still reports success (FR-016).

### Step 9: `--parallel` (opt-in fan-out)

Default off = strictly sequential per-phase dispatch with the single agent named above. When `--parallel` is set, the harness MAY parallelize independent phase work and prefer cheaper models at its discretion — **without** changing the resolved phase set or order (execution strategy only, FR-024).

## CLI

```
scripts/resolve_phases.py [--skip a,b] [--add x,y] [--json] [--explain]
scripts/resolve_phases.py --plan-only [--add x,y]  # planning-only: skip implement (forced)
scripts/resolve_phases.py --skip implement --allow-required-skip  # explicit forced required-skip
scripts/resolve_phases.py --list          # dump the registry, bypass resolution
scripts/preflight.sh <phase-id>...        # verify phase skills + .specify present
```

Resolver exit codes:

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | resolved OK, ordered phase list on stdout |
| 2 | usage error |
| 10 | unknown phase name (skip or add) — stderr lists valid names |
| 11 | skip/add same-phase conflict |
| 12 | add-list name not in the insertable set |
| 13 | skip-list targets a required phase (`specify`/`implement`) **without** `--allow-required-skip`/`--plan-only` (opt-out guard; a forced skip breaking a dep still fails `14`) |
| 14 | dependency break — a retained phase's dependency was skipped |

## Hard stops

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Empty feature description | Report missing input; do not start (FR-001). |
| Resolver returns non-zero | Report the message; run no phase (FR-012/FR-013). |
| Required phase skill or `.specify/` missing at preflight | Report; do not start (FR-015). |
| Dispatched artifact absent after a phase | Halt, name the phase; do not proceed (FR-025). |
| Analyze unresolved after 2 cycles (new mode) / 3 cycles (legacy) | Halt; report unresolved findings (FR-021). |
| `clarify-surrogate` flags a question unresolved (`--yes` runs, legacy mode only) | Halt before `plan`, name the question and why; never guess (FR-020a). |
| `--yes` reaches the clarify gate in new mode | Halt for operator answers — `clarify-surrogate` is disabled in new mode (P3), `--yes` does not bypass this gate. |
| Destructive/irreversible action during implement | Halt and ask, per `act-autonomously` (FR-018). |

## Cost discipline

- Sequential single-agent dispatch by default; parallel/Workflow fan-out only under `--parallel`.
- Dispatch prompts carry maximum-intensity caveman; artifacts and code never do.
- Optional outputs degrade gracefully — never fail the pipeline over a missing recap/illustration.

## Cross-skill interaction

| Skill | Relationship |
|---|---|
| `speckit-*` | The phases this skill orchestrates (transcluded, never reimplemented). |
| `act-autonomously` | Supplies the unattended-execution discipline for the post-clarify tail. |
| `nested-notes` | `--summary` renderer. |
| `accelerate` | `--illustrate` renderer. |
| `clarify-surrogate` (`.claude/agents/clarify-surrogate.md`) | Legacy mode only: answers `/speckit-clarify`'s questions in place of a human under `--yes`; inherits the orchestrating session's model. Disabled in new mode (default) — new mode halts at clarify for the operator regardless of `--yes` (P3). |
| `cavecrew-builder` | The Haiku builder preset the `implement` phase dispatches to. |

## Version History

- **v1.5-agents_Inc.2** (2026-09-07) — the `workerbees/` governance slice's SQLite schema now natively speaks the D27 rung vocabulary (D36: `grunt`/`workhorse`/`orchestrator`/`executive` replace `cheap`/`mid`/`frontier` across `SCHEMA-3NF.md`, `routing.json`, `models.json`, and every consumer module). `ledger_bridge.py` simplified accordingly — it now just normalizes a rung name (D34 `Supervisor` synonym included) straight to the schema's `tier` column, no bucket-mapping layer. `tests/smoke_ledger_bridge.sh` (6 assertions) extended to prove the gate-reason lint requirement survived the rename (an executive-tier dispatch missing a gate reason is still flagged).
- **v1.5-agents_Inc.1** (2026-09-07) — agents_for_dummies-native fork addition (D35): real CLASS->model resolution (`scripts/resolve_rung.py`, parses `docs/governance/ROUTING-RANKING.md` live, fails closed) replaces eyeballed-prose resolution; every new-mode phase dispatch is now recorded into this repo's real ledger (`scripts/ledger_bridge.py`) for lineage/cost-rollup/lint parity with the rest of the repo's governed dispatches, and threads an artifact sha256 through the existing (imperfect) capture path spec 006 documents, readying — not building — a future Bindle seam. Found a real bug in the process (superseded by D36 above, see v1.5-agents_Inc.2): `workerbees/ledger.py`'s SQLite schema hardcoded `tier CHECK (tier IN ('cheap','mid','frontier'))` (pre-D27 vocabulary) — passing a D27 rung name straight into `tier` silently failed to persist to SQLite (swallowed `IntegrityError`, JSONL still wrote, `record_dispatch` still reported success). `tests/smoke_ledger_bridge.sh` (initially 5 assertions, all passing) covers the fix against an isolated temp workspace, never the real `.workerbees/` ledger.

- **v1.5** (2026-09-06) — `specs/008-pipeline-model-classes` (consumer-side spec). New mode becomes **DEFAULT**: phases bind to provider-agnostic classes (`Executive`/`Orchestrator` (aka `Supervisor`)/`Workhorse`/`Grunt`/`free`, existing D27 rung vocabulary — no new class tokens introduced) resolved to a concrete model at dispatch time from `docs/governance/ROUTING-RANKING.md`, not a hardcoded table, and default effort is `medium` everywhere. `--legacy` retains the old hardcoded-model table, also dropped to default effort `medium` (was `high`). New mode disables `clarify-surrogate` outright (P3 — a surrogate answering clarify then feeding plan is a self-graded input); `--yes` in new mode still halts at the clarify gate for the operator. Analyze retry cap drops 3 → 2 cycles in new mode only (legacy keeps 3). Preflight (new mode only) tolerates a missing `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh` with a warning instead of failing, since a consumer repo not scaffolded by upstream `spec-kit` may lack it. No change to the phase registry, resolver, or `speckit-*` phase skills themselves — only this skill's own policy table, mode selection, and preflight.
- **v1.4** (2026-07-15) — `#405` — allow excluding *any* phase, not just insertable ones. The required-phase guard (`specify`/`implement`) is now **opt-out**, not absolute: `--allow-required-skip` on the CLI (`force=True` on `resolve()`) bypasses the exit-13 `RequiredPhaseSkip` check, and `--plan-only` is convenience sugar for a planning/checkpoint run (skips `implement`, implies the force). The dependency checker (`DepBreak`, exit 14) remains the real backstop — forcing `--skip specify` still fails because `clarify`/`plan`/`checklist`/`analyze` depend on it, so operators get a precise list of what else to skip rather than a silent broken pipeline. Default behavior unchanged (a bare `--skip implement` still exits 13), so every existing caller and test is untouched. Serves the diagnosis-only pipeline the QuADMESH-RL spec-015 run needed (`specify→plan→tasks→checklist→analyze`, no `implement`) that previously forced a manual orchestration halt. New resolver `force` param + two CLI flags + 4 tests (17 total). Additive.
- **v1.3** (2026-07-09) — Docs-only. Added an "Analyze vs. converge" section clarifying that `analyze` is a pre-implement cross-artifact consistency check (findings fixed in artifacts, never code) versus the post-implement code-vs-spec `converge` check, and documented `speckit-converge` as a pending port from upstream `github/spec-kit` (#3001) — the phase is deliberately not wired into the registry until the skill exists, since `preflight.sh` would otherwise fail. Prompted by the `github/spec-kit` pipeline-workflow review (PR #3338), where the same analyze/implement mispairing surfaced. No behavior change; registry, resolver, and dispatch policy unchanged.
- **v1.2** (2026-07-05) — Renamed `speckit-workflow` → `speckit-pipeline` (operator-directed). Skill dir, `name:` frontmatter, self-referencing script/test paths, MANIFEST entry, and live cross-refs (`.claude/agents/*`, `clarify-surrogate`) updated. Historical spec `017-speckit-workflow` keeps its dir/id (spec of record, not renamed). No behavior change — the phase registry, resolver, and dispatch policy are identical. A fully-generic, DomI-decoupled port of this pipeline is staged at `contrib/spec-kit/pipeline/` for upstream contribution to `github/spec-kit`.
- **v1.1** (2026-07-03) — Operator-directed revision: `--yes` no longer skips the clarify gate with a warning. It now dispatches a new `clarify-surrogate` subagent (`.claude/agents/clarify-surrogate.md`) that answers `/speckit-clarify`'s questions grounded in the spec/repo, spawned without a model override so it inherits the orchestrating session's own model tier — an unattended/optimized run gets real clarification answers instead of none. A literal no-answers skip remains available only via the structurally separate `--skip clarify`. If the surrogate can't responsibly answer (insufficient grounding, security/scope stakes, materially shape-changing decision), it flags the question unresolved and the run halts before `plan` rather than guessing (FR-020a). New Hard Stop row + Cross-skill entry.
- **v1.0** (2026-07-03) — Initial. Spec-driven-development pipeline orchestrator (spec `017-speckit-workflow`). SKILL.md-driven hybrid: main-session inline `Skill` for interactive/docs phases, `Agent` dispatch with fresh transclusion for subagent phases, pure-Python deterministic phase resolver, `act-autonomously` unattended tail, optional `nested-notes`/`accelerate` outputs, opt-in `--parallel`.
